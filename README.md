# ClinVar RDF converter

The converter was initially developed at https://github.com/ktym/clinvar_rdf and the ontology was originally developed at https://github.com/dbcls/clinvar-ontology which are now included as submodules.

The latest converter supports the beta version of the ClinVar XML which was announced at https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017/07/25/clinvar-variant-based-xml-summaries/ and released at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/xml/clinvar_variation/beta
